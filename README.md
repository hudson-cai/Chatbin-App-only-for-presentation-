### Index Page (Login Page)

Index Page is the entry point of the application. It is the page where users can login to their accounts or register for a new account. In addition, four modals are added to the index page to provide users with more information about Chatbin.

### Chat Page

Chat Page is where users can chat with Chatbin. User's messages and the conversation will be displayed on the chat page. The scroll bar will automatically scroll to the bottom of the page when the page is loaded or when a new message is sent.

Additionally, customised Chatbot is used to respond to the user's negative messages by detecting key words.

## Part 2: How to initialize this app?

1. `python3 -m venv venv`
   Create a virtual environment under the main directory (CITS5505_Project2).
   And then you can find a new folder called 'venv' under the main directory.
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
   Activate the virtual environment.
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   This is to install all dependencies for this application
4. `flask shell`
   Enter python terminal in the virtual environment
5. `flask db init`
   Create the migration repository for chatbin
6. `flask db migrate -m "users table"`
   With the migration repository in place, it is time to create the first database migration, which will include the users table that maps to the User database model.
   The `flask db migrate` sub-command generates these automatic migrations.
7. `flask db upgrade`
   The flask db migrate command does not make any changes to the database, it just generates the migration script. To apply the changes to the database, the flask db upgrade command must be used.
8. `export FLASK_APP=chatbin.py`
   Before running it, though, Flask needs to be told how to import it, by setting the FLASK_APP environment variable.
9. Use Ctrl + C to exit the python terminal
10. `flask run`
    Now the app is running on 127.0.0.1/5000
